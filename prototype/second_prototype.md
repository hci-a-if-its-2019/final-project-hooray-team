### 4. Feedback and Incidence Analysis

#### OBSERVATION 1 - User Management

![Users Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/users_management.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION 2 - Groups Management

![Groups Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/groups_management.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 3 - Modules Management

![Modules Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/modules.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 4 - Subjects Management

![Subjects Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/subjects.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 5 - Questions Management

![Question Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/question_management.JPG)
![Question Management (continue)](/assets/prototype/prototype2/question_management2.JPG)

- **Reference**: E16
- **Feedback**: Explicitly positive
- **Incidence**: Participant says using asterisk to make sure it's required is useful
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 6 - Answer Management

![Answer Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/answer_management.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 7 - Question Lists

![Question Lists](/assets/prototype/prototype2/question_list.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION 8 - Answer Lists

![Answer Lists](/assets/prototype/prototype2/answer_list.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION 9 - Test Management

![Test Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/test_management.JPG)

- **Reference**: [C14, D38, D22, E21, F22, G27]
- **Feedback**: Implicitly Negative
- **Incidence**: The participant didn't realize that there are another two tabs on the same page and not understanding the test time meaning, lack of detail on some same type input
- **Reason**: When the participant reached the bottom of the page, they try to find another feature in the navigation bar, the participant confuse the different between start end time and test time
- **Resolution**: add test time unit and make a form progress bar or next button on the footer page, adding self explanation below input

#### OBSERVATION 10 - Test to Subjects

![Test to Subjects](/assets/prototype/prototype2/test_to_subjects.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION 11 - Test to Groups

![Test to Groups](/assets/prototype/prototype2/test_to_groups.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION a - Every long form page

- **Reference**: F29
- **Feedback**: Using another approach to solve problem
- **Incidence**: Using a floating button rather than placing it on bottom of the form to make it easier to check
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: Using *Discord'ish* floating button is quite good approach to solve this
