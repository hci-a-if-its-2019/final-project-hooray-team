  - Never using e-learning before, but often use app/web to help his teaching method

### 2. Evaluation Script
1. Login as default admin with username and password as admin and 1234
2. Create a new user with his/her level is not equal to zero (since it cannot be used)
3. Create a new group named 'HCI A Class' and move the user to this group
4. Create a new module named 'Technology'
5. Create a new topic named 'Human-Computer' and fill in description as 'the interaction between humans and computers'
6. Change the topic name to 'Human Computer Interaction'
7. In the module 'Technology' with topic 'Human Computer Interaction', create a question.
8. Create an answer based on the created question.
9. Change single answer question to appear as the first question in any tests.
10. Create a test
 - Name: IMK
 - Description: IMK for Contextual Inquiry of Horray Team
 - Start time: today date and End time: tomorrow date
 - Test time: 60 minutes
 - Groups: HCI A Class
 - Basic points: 4; Points for wrong answer: -1; Points for no answer: 0; Points to pass the exam: 0
11. Set questions which have been created previously as the question for the test

### 4. Feedback and Incidence Analysis

#### OBSERVATION 1 - User Management

![Users Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/users_management.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION 2 - Groups Management

![Groups Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/groups_management.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 3 - Modules Management

![Modules Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/modules.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: - 
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 4 - Subjects Management

![Subjects Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/subjects.JPG)

- **Reference**: [A18 - A22]
- **Feedback**: Explicitly Negative
- **Incidence**: Participant said that subject menu is hidden and hard to see
- **Reason**: Subject menu is a part of Modules Information in other tab
- **Resolution**: Add button next to Module Information to reference to Subject Information


#### OBSERVATION 5 - Questions Management

![Question Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/question_management.JPG)
![Question Management (continue)](/assets/prototype/prototype2/question_management2.JPG)

- **Reference**: E16, A37
- **Feedback**: Explicitly positive
- **Incidence**: Participant says using asterisk to make sure it's required is useful; 
Participant A said that showing answers below related questions is useful since user need not to go back and forth
between question and answer management tabs 
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 6 - Answer Management

![Answer Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/answer_management.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -


#### OBSERVATION 7 - Question Lists

![Question Lists](/assets/prototype/prototype2/question_list.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION 8 - Answer Lists

![Answer Lists](/assets/prototype/prototype2/answer_list.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION 9 - Test Management

![Test Management](/assets/prototype/prototype2/test_management.JPG)

- **Reference**: [C14, D38, D22, E21, F22, G27]
- **Feedback**: Implicitly Negative
- **Incidence**: The participant didn't realize that there are another two tabs on the same page and not understanding the test time meaning, lack of detail on some same type input
- **Reason**: When the participant reached the bottom of the page, they try to find another feature in the navigation bar, the participant confuse the different between start end time and test time
- **Resolution**: add test time unit and make a form progress bar or next button on the footer page, adding self explanation below input

#### OBSERVATION 10 - Test to Subjects

![Test to Subjects](/assets/prototype/prototype2/test_to_subjects.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION 11 - Test to Groups

![Test to Groups](/assets/prototype/prototype2/test_to_groups.JPG)

- **Reference**: -
- **Feedback**: -
- **Incidence**: -
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: -

#### OBSERVATION a - Every long form page

- **Reference**: F29
- **Feedback**: Using another approach to solve problem
- **Incidence**: Using a floating button rather than placing it on bottom of the form to make it easier to check
- **Reason**: -
- **Resolution**: Using *Discord'ish* floating button is quite good approach to solve this

## Part B: Prototyping (again)

### Sketch (Edited screen only)

![Edited sketch](https://gsculerlor.s-ul.eu/xEbXC3aZ)



### Design Rationale

Based on observation result, we still need to add more explanation to some fields that kinda similar with the others. Also for solving save button feedback, it's kinda weird if we implement *Google Material Design* language to our floating button, thus I found out that *Discord* have unique approach that let user can scroll up and down while checking their input and still doesn't need to scroll to bottom to save it.
