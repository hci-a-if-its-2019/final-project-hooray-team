### 2. Version Differences

#### Questions Answers Management
1. First Version
On the first version, question and answer is placed on different tabs in the same menu. 
This is to accomodate if there are a lot of answers with explanation for the selected question.
2. Second Version
On the second version, question and answer is placed on the same page.
If user wants to add answer to the selected question, user only need to click on the plus button and the page 
dynamically add new editing panel for answer. When user clicks outside the panel, the answer is 
automatically saved. These panel can also be re-arranged to determine answer position.

#### Test Management
1. First Version
This version separate where to create test, assign test to several subjects, and assign test to several groups.
2. Second Version
This version combined everything in the same page. Both assign to subjects and assign to groups are become a 
multiple select. 
### 3. Selected Sketch
For question answer management, we combine both version with the question can list saved answer and also create
tabs for answer management. In this selected sketch, list of answer below question can also be re-arranged.
For test management, we choose the first version to separate the how to assign test to subjects or groups.

### 4. Design Rationale
The core problem in original TCExam is bad design on their platform. Lack of explanation, too-old-styled themed layout and not well-centered layout design make user uncomfortable and sometimes missed the feature. From that, we need to fix it by using the simple, minimalist, yet modern and self-explained layout design.
