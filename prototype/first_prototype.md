# Sketching and Prototyping

## Part A: Sketches

### Design Rationale

The core problem in original TCExam is bad design on their platform. Lack of explanation, too-old-styled themed layout and not well-centered layout design make user uncomfortable and sometimes missed the feature. From that, we need to fix it by using the simple, minimalist, yet modern and self-explained layout design.

## Part B: Assumptions

### Hardware

PC with minimum spec:

- Intel dual core processor
- RAM 2 GB
- Internet connection of course
- Dedicated graphic card, minimum Intel HD

Navigation with external hardware (mouse and/or keyboard)

### Users

- Highly related with education stuff (maybe teacher, lectures, or students)
- Can use browser to browsing 
- Can understand how to input something on online form
- ~15-50 years old
