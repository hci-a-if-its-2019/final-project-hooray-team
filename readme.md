## System's Description
TCExam is a Open Source system for electronic exams (also know as CBA - Computer-Based Assessment, CBT - Computer-Based Testing or e-exam) that enables educators and trainers to author, schedule, deliver, and report on quizzes, tests and exams.

TCExam is Web-Based, platform independent, language independent (includes translations in several languages and RTL support) and conforms to W3C Accessibility and Usability guidelines to provide equal opportunity to people with disabilities, including blind users.

TCExam automates all assessment phases: authoring, scheduling, delivering, and reporting. It's easy to use and do not require expensive hardware to run, nor additional commercial software. Users connect to the TCExam system using a common Web-browser like Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer.

# Sketching and Prototyping
## Part A: Sketches

### Design Rationale

The core problem in original TCExam is bad design on their platform. Lack of explanation, too-old-styled themed layout and not well-centered layout design make user uncomfortable and sometimes missed the feature. From that, we need to fix it by using the simple, minimalist, yet modern and self-explained layout design.

## Part B: Assumptions

### Hardware

PC with minimum spec:

- Intel dual core processor
- RAM 2 GB
- Internet connection of course
- Dedicated graphic card, minimum Intel HD

Navigation with external hardware (mouse and/or keyboard)

### Users

- Can use browser to browsing 
- Can understand how to input something on online form
- ~15-50 years old
